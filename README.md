# Hi, I’m @bitcointroy
- I’m interested in 
  - aviation
  - cryptocurrency
  - machine learning
- I’m currently learning 
  - aviation (PPL, A&P)
  - cryptocurrency (smart contracts, flash loans, NFTs)
  - machine learning (laptop executable models for price predictions)
- I’m looking to collaborate on 
  - hybrid (electric and ICE) propulsion for general aviation aircraft
  - real estate titles on blockchain projects (between smart contracts and NFTs, we have no excuse for using centuries old procedures to transfer ownership of real estate between each other)
  - something interesting making machine learning run on old (affordable) hardware.
